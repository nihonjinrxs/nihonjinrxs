### Welcome, friend :wave:

You've stumbed upon the Github home of Ryan B. Harvey, alias `nihonjinrxs` or `CodeAndData`. My pronouns are he/him/his. You can find out more about my prior work and activities at [codeanddata.codes](https://codeanddata.codes).

I'm a fun-loving geek who is driven to create useful things (mostly with code) almost as much as I am called to teach others how to do it themselves. I enjoy diving into data and have been known to get lost in SQL at times. I'm passionate about clean, purposeful interfaces and joyous user experiences. I read lots of books, but never seem to get through my reading list. I'm a happy husband and father of two.

I've just started a new role as a Staff Software Engineer with the amazing team at [Screencastify](https://screencastify.com), a startup helping to make video-based instruction easy for teachers and school districts by providing a suite of tools for creation and editing of videos and assignment creation and tracking based on those videos.

On the side, you might find me leading the [Code for New Orleans](https://codeforneworleans.org) volunteer brigade of [Code for America](https://codeforamerica.org), contributing to projects at [Ruby for Good](https://rubyforgood.org/), or teaching Computer Science at [Loyola University New Orleans](https://www.loyno.edu/academics/colleges/college-arts-sciences/computer-science). I also enjoy exploring Elixir and Rust, video game randomizers, and computer generated music and art, though I don't claim to be good at any of those.

#### **Prior work**

Before Screencastify, I worked at [Healthify](https://healthify.us), a startup (since bought by [WellSky](https://wellsky.com)) enabling organizations to address the social determinants of health by providing solutions for identifying social needs, searching for social services, and coordinating care with an integrated network of community partners to improve outcomes. While there, I worked on improving infrastructure and reporting availability, including launching a self-serve reporting feature for users of the app, primarily in Aptible, Docker and Ruby on Rails, with a bit of AWS, Python, JS, bash, dbt, and Looker LookML in the mix.

Prior to that, I was on the powerhouse Tech team at [TED](https://www.ted.com), where I worked on video engineering. In that role, I created (and still maintain) the [Fessonia library](https://npmjs.com/package/@tedconf/fessonia) to interface Node.js to the FFmpeg command line, and built our video encoding platform, working mostly in Node.js and Ruby on Rails. I also worked on the Analytics team and built out the backend recommendation system and API for the TED Recommends product using R, Node.js, and Golang. Before that, I was an engineer and engineering manager at the [White House Office of Management and Budget](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/) and a computer scientist at the [Social Security Administration](https://socialsecurity.gov).
