I'm a fun-loving geek :neckbeard: who is driven to create useful things üèóÔ∏è (mostly with code) almost as much as I am called to teach üë®‚Äçüè´ others how to do it themselves. I work hard to improve the lives of others in my free time and want to do so at work too ü§ù. I enjoy diving into data and have been known to get lost in SQL at times. I'm passionate about clean, purposeful interfaces ‚ú® and joyous user experiences ü•∞. I read lots of books :books:, but never seem to get through my reading list. I'm a happy husband üíë and father of two üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶.

I'm a Staff-level Software Engineer on the Customer Experience digital services team in the CIO shop at FEMA, where we're working to enable better technology delivery at the agency in support of survivor experience with FEMA's individual assistance programs. In that role, I'm building web-based software using Java <img src="https://cr.openjdk.org/~jeff/Duke/png/ChezDuke.png" alt="Java's Duke mascot" width="19px" height="21px"></a> and Spring <a href="https://spring.io" title="Spring framework"><img src="https://spring.io/img/spring.svg" alt="Spring Framework" width="21px" height="19px"></a> on AWS <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/" title="Amazon Web Services (AWS)"><img src="https://github.com/tomchen/stack-icons/blob/master/logos/aws.svg" alt="AWS" width="21px" height="21px"></a>. I also support disaster deployments when needed by performing GIS-based damage assessment using ESRI tools.

On the side, you might find me mentoring students on the high school robotics team [FRC Team 2992, The S. S. Prometheus](https://mandevillerobotics.org) and the junior high robotics team [FTC Team 25619, Nova Pyra](https://novapyra.org) or [teaching Computer Science](https://www.loyno.edu/academics/faculty-and-staff-directory/mr-ryan-harvey) at [Loyola University New Orleans](https://www.loyno.edu/academics/colleges/college-arts-sciences/computer-science). You can find course information, syllabi, etc., on [my faculty website](https://codeanddata.codes/loyno-faculty-site). I also enjoy exploring robotics and IoT, Rust <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/" title="Rust"><img src="https://github.com/tomchen/stack-icons/blob/master/logos/rust.svg" alt="Rust" width="21px" height="21px"></a>, video game randomizers, and computer generated music and art, though I don't claim to be good at any of those.

#### **Prior work**

Previouosly, I was a member of the Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority's [Technology Innovation Department](https://tid.mbta.com/) as a Sr. Software Engineer (contract) on the Fares Tech Team, where we were working to provide a more rider-friendly experience managing passes and farecards through the MyCharlie web app. In that role, I built web-based software using Elixir <a href="https://elixir-lang.org" title="Elixir"><img src="https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir-lang.github.com/blob/main/downloads/logos/elixir-vertical.png" alt="Elixir" width="12px" height="21px"></a> and Phoenix <a href="https://phoenixframework.org" title="Phoenix Framework"><img src="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/assets/logo.png" alt="Phoenix Framework" width="21px" height="12px"></a> on AWS <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/" title="Amazon Web Services (AWS)"><img src="https://github.com/tomchen/stack-icons/blob/master/logos/aws.svg" alt="AWS" width="21px" height="21px"></a>.

Before MBTA, I was a Staff Software Engineer at [Screencastify](https://screencastify.com), a startup helping to make video-based instruction easy for teachers and school districts by providing a suite of tools for creation and editing of videos and assignment creation and tracking based on those videos. In that role, I did a variety of work to help the team operate effectively and the company be successful, including de-risking and prototyping new ideas and approaches, breaking down and planning engineering work, architecting large-scale changes to the code bases, identifying patterns and technologies that we can build on, coaching and mentoring colleagues, building software and supporting systems, and pairing and mobbing with fellow engineers to solve problems.

On the volunteer side, I led the [Code for New Orleans](https://codeforneworleans.org) volunteer brigade of [Code for America](https://codeforamerica.org) from 2016 until the brigade program was discontinued in 2023, and have been a contributor and project lead with a few projects of [Ruby for Good](https://rubyforgood.org/).

Before Screencastify, I worked at [Healthify](https://healthify.us), a startup (since bought by [WellSky](https://wellsky.com)) enabling organizations to address the social determinants of health by providing solutions for identifying social needs, searching for social services, and coordinating care with an integrated network of community partners to improve outcomes. While there, I worked on improving infrastructure and reporting availability, including launching a self-serve reporting feature for users of the app, primarily in Aptible, Docker <a href="https://www.docker.com/" title="Docker"><img src="https://github.com/tomchen/stack-icons/blob/master/logos/docker-icon.svg" alt="Docker" width="21px" height="21px"></a> and Ruby <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/" title="Ruby"><img src="https://github.com/tomchen/stack-icons/blob/master/logos/ruby.svg" alt="Ruby" width="21px" height="21px"></a> on Rails <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/" title="Ruby on Rails"><img src="https://github.com/tomchen/stack-icons/blob/master/logos/rails.svg" alt="Ruby on Rails" width="21px" height="21px"></a>, with a bit of AWS <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/" title="Amazon Web Services (AWS)"><img src="https://github.com/tomchen/stack-icons/blob/master/logos/aws.svg" alt="AWS" width="21px" height="21px"></a>, Python <a href="https://www.python.org/" title="Python"><img src="https://github.com/tomchen/stack-icons/blob/master/logos/python.svg" alt="Python" width="21px" height="21px"></a>, JS <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript" title="JavaScript"><img src="https://github.com/tomchen/stack-icons/blob/master/logos/javascript.svg" alt="JavaScript" width="21px" height="21px"></a>, bash <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/" title="bash"><img src="https://github.com/tomchen/stack-icons/blob/master/logos/bash.svg" alt="bash" width="21px" height="21px"></a>, dbt <a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/" title="dbt"><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/b8dc46ef553c76847d944665fe5cebdea2e86542/83803/img/dbt-logo-light.svg" alt="dbt" width="21px" height="21px"></a>, and Looker LookML <a href="https://www.looker.com/" title="Looker"><img src="https://github.com/tomchen/stack-icons/blob/master/logos/looker.svg" alt="Looker" width="21px" height="21px"></a> in the mix.

Prior to that, I was on the powerhouse Tech team at [TED](https://www.ted.com), where I worked on video engineering. In that role, I created (and still maintain) the [Fessonia library](https://npmjs.com/package/@tedconf/fessonia) to interface Node.js <a href="https://nodejs.org/" title="Node.js"><img src="https://github.com/tomchen/stack-icons/blob/master/logos/nodejs-icon.svg" alt="Node.js" width="21px" height="21px"></a> to the FFmpeg command line, and built our video encoding platform, working mostly in Node.js <a href="https://nodejs.org/" title="Node.js"><img src="https://github.com/tomchen/stack-icons/blob/master/logos/nodejs-icon.svg" alt="Node.js" width="21px" height="21px"></a> and Ruby <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/" title="Ruby"><img src="https://github.com/tomchen/stack-icons/blob/master/logos/ruby.svg" alt="Ruby" width="21px" height="21px"></a> on Rails <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/" title="Ruby on Rails"><img src="https://github.com/tomchen/stack-icons/blob/master/logos/rails.svg" alt="Ruby on Rails" width="21px" height="21px"></a>. I also worked on the Analytics team and built out the backend recommendation system and API for the TED Recommends product using R <a href="https://www.r-project.org/" title="R"><img src="https://github.com/tomchen/stack-icons/blob/master/logos/r-lang.svg" alt="R" width="21px" height="21px"></a>, Node.js <a href="https://nodejs.org/" title="Node.js"><img src="https://github.com/tomchen/stack-icons/blob/master/logos/nodejs-icon.svg" alt="Node.js" width="21px" height="21px"></a>, and Golang <a href="https://golang.google.com/" title="Golang"><img src="https://github.com/tomchen/stack-icons/blob/master/logos/go.svg" alt="Node.js" width="21px" height="21px"></a>. Before that, I was an engineer and engineering manager at the [White House Office of Management and Budget](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/) and a computer scientist at the [Social Security Administration](https://socialsecurity.gov).
